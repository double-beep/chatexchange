/**
 * This class represents a chat message.
 * <p>The content of the message is either plain or not. A plain content is the original markdown source of the message, whereas
 * a formatted content is the rendered HTML of the message. For example, a formatted cv-pls message will contain
 * an anchor (linking to the tag page for cv-pls) and the corresponding plain message will contain <code>[tag:cv-pls]</code> instead.
 * <p>A message is inherently linked to a chat room: an instance of {@link Message} can only be obtained by calling {@link Room#getMessage(long)},
 * by giving it the id of the message to look for.
 * <p>A message also contains a reference to the user that posted it. Refer to {@link User}.
 * <p>When a message is deleted, its content and user will always be <code>null</code>, except if the current user is room-owner
 * or it is one of their own message.
