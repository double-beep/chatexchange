/**
 * Base class for all events raised in chat.
 * <p>An event represents an action that was triggered by a user or a system action. Actions made by user typically corresponds
 * to posting messages, editing messages, etc. and actions made by the system typically corresponds to feeds added, change in
 * access level, etc.
 * <p>All events have a instant at which they occured, represented by an {@link Instant} object (UTC). They also have the user that
 * triggered the action (ID and display name), with the exception of anonymous events (like starring).
 * For system events, the ID will be strictly negative and for anonymous events, it is will be 0.
